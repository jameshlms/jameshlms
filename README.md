### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**jameshlms/jameshlms** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ At the moment I am spending time studying but I hope to develop more independent projects.
- ğŸŒ± Currently I am learning about the fundamentals of data science and artificial intelligence.
- ğŸ‘¯ I hope to collaborate with groups who follow similar interests of even software/web app development.
- âš¡ Fun fact: Lived in Germany for 4 years and now living in North Carolina, studying at UNC at Charlotte.
