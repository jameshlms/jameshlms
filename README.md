## What I do 💻

🛠️ I develop small projects for the time being, pertaining to topics and technologies that interest me and will further my career. Recently I've been learning and building projects about end-to-end pipelines for data and the handling of the data lifecycle from data storage solutions to model training to serving.

🍎 I attend the University of North Carolina at Charlotte and in my third year of the bachelor's of science in data science.

## 💡 Personal Bits

I like being surrounded by people whether they're friends, classmates, or coworkers. I prioritize warmth in my interactions while fitting the environment like professional settings or friendly group work. I find fulfillment in being helpful to others and being an individual that can be sought to for assistance. I do my best to address help in ways that feel genuine and productive.

I have a handful of interests like...
- Coffee making with my Bialetti Moka Pot, still working on my latte art skills though!
- Watching various genres of movies and reading comic books (especially Batman ones)
- Cooking for myself and friends and trying recipes and food from places with unique and differing palettes and history to those of cultures I'm familiar with.
