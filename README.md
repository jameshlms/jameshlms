## What I Do

I develop small projects for the time being, pertaining to topics and technologies that interest me and will further my career. Recently I've been learning and building projects about end-to-end pipelines for data and the handling of the data lifecycle from data storage solutions to model training to serving.

I attend the University of North Carolina at Charlotte and in my third year of the bachelor's of science in data science.

**jameshlms/jameshlms** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 At the moment I am spending time studying but I hope to develop more independent projects.
- 🌱 Currently I am learning about the fundamentals of data science and artificial intelligence.
- 👯 I hope to collaborate with groups who follow similar interests of even software/web app development.
- ⚡ Fun fact: Lived in Germany for 4 years and now living in North Carolina, studying at UNC at Charlotte.
