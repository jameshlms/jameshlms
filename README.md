# READ about ME!

A short README.md of who I am.

## James Holmes

### Career & Study
Currently, a student pursuing a career in data science and machine learning engineering (maybe even data engineering). I am working to obtain my Bachelors of Science in Data Science and after a Masters in Data Science and Business Analytics.

### Interests in my Field
I find that data (when used responsibly) can help us find paths to potential solutions and help get rid of inconenviences in our lives, even if we may not know exactly the "why" of it. Even the way we store and move data between data storage to the hands of data scientists and analysts is a game of consistency and ease-of-use.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ At the moment I am spending time studying but I hope to develop more independent projects.
- ðŸŒ± Currently I am learning about the fundamentals of data science and artificial intelligence.
- ðŸ‘¯ I hope to collaborate with groups who follow similar interests of even software/web app development.
- âš¡ Fun fact: Lived in Germany for 4 years and now living in North Carolina, studying at UNC at Charlotte.
