# A Little Bit About Me

This README.md is a short description of me to get to know me a little bit.

## James Holmes

A programmer set on learning the most I can.

## Description

Currently I am studying data science and AI development.

Currently due to focusing on my studies, developing my own projects has been a slow process.

As of now I am slowly developing my own web portfolio to demonstrate my coding abilities.
